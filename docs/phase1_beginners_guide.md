# Phase 1: REPL and Signal Handling - A Complete Beginner's Guide

## **What is a REPL? (The Simple Explanation)**

Imagine you're having a conversation with a very smart assistant. You say something, they respond, and then they wait for your next input. This conversation continues until you decide to end it.

**REPL** (Read-Eval-Print Loop) is exactly like that - but for computer commands!

### **Real-World Analogy: A Restaurant Service**
Think of a restaurant:
1. **Waiter approaches** (shows prompt)
2. **Customer orders** (types command)
3. **Kitchen prepares** (processes command)
4. **Food is served** (shows result)
5. **Waiter returns** (shows prompt again)
6. **Repeat until customer leaves**

**In our shell**, it works the same way:
1. **Show prompt** (`minishell$ `)
2. **Read command** (`echo hello`)
3. **Process command** (execute echo)
4. **Show result** (`hello`)
5. **Show prompt again** (`minishell$ `)
6. **Repeat until user exits**

## **Why Do We Need a REPL?**

### **The Problem Without a REPL**
Without a REPL, you'd have to restart the program for each command:

```bash
# Without REPL (tedious!)
./minishell
echo hello
# Program exits, you have to restart
./minishell
ls
# Program exits, you have to restart
./minishell
pwd
# Program exits, you have to restart
```

### **The Solution With a REPL**
With a REPL, you can run multiple commands in one session:

```bash
# With REPL (convenient!)
./minishell
minishell$ echo hello
hello
minishell$ ls
file1.txt file2.txt
minishell$ pwd
/home/user
minishell$ exit
```

**Why this matters**: You can work efficiently without constantly restarting!

## **How the REPL Works (Step by Step)**

### **The Analogy: A Conversation Loop**

Think of the REPL like a **conversation loop**:

#### **Step 1: Read (Listen)**
```c
char *line = readline(shell->prompt);
```
**The Analogy**: Like listening to what someone says.

**What it does**: Waits for the user to type a command and press Enter.

#### **Step 2: Evaluate (Think)**
```c
if (ft_strlen(line) > 0) {
    add_history(line);
    process_command(line);
}
```
**The Analogy**: Like thinking about what the person said.

**What it does**: Processes the command and figures out what to do.

#### **Step 3: Print (Respond)**
```c
// Command output is shown
// Prompt is shown again
```
**The Analogy**: Like responding to what the person said.

**What it does**: Shows the result and waits for the next command.

#### **Step 4: Loop (Repeat)**
```c
while (1) {
    // Read, Evaluate, Print
}
```
**The Analogy**: Like continuing the conversation.

**What it does**: Repeats the process until the user decides to exit.

## **Signal Handling: The Interrupt System**

### **The Analogy: Emergency Procedures**

Think of signal handling like **emergency procedures** in a building:

#### **Ctrl+C (SIGINT) - Fire Alarm**
**What it is**: Interrupts the current operation.

**The Analogy**: Like a fire alarm - stops everything and evacuates.

**What happens**:
- **Interactive mode**: Shows new prompt, continues running
- **Non-interactive mode**: Exits the program

#### **Ctrl+D (EOF) - Power Outage**
**What it is**: End of input (like closing a file).

**The Analogy**: Like a power outage - shuts down gracefully.

**What happens**:
- **Interactive mode**: Shows "exit" and closes
- **Non-interactive mode**: Exits immediately

#### **Ctrl+\ (SIGQUIT) - False Alarm**
**What it is**: Quit signal (usually ignored).

**The Analogy**: Like a false alarm - nothing happens.

**What happens**:
- **Interactive mode**: Ignored (does nothing)
- **Non-interactive mode**: Exits with core dump

---

## **The Global Signal Variable**

### **The Analogy: An Emergency Status Board**

Think of the global signal variable like an **emergency status board** in a building:

```c
volatile sig_atomic_t g_signal = 0;
```

#### **Why We Need It**
**The Problem**: Signal handlers can't directly communicate with the main program.

**The Analogy**: Like a fire alarm that can't directly tell the manager what happened.

**The Solution**: Use a global variable as a communication channel.

#### **How It Works**
```c
// Signal handler sets the flag
void signal_handler(int sig) {
    g_signal = sig;  // "Fire alarm went off!"
}

// Main loop checks the flag
if (g_signal == SIGINT) {
    // "Oh, fire alarm went off, let's evacuate!"
    handle_interrupt();
}
```

### **Why `volatile` and `sig_atomic_t`?**

#### **`volatile` - "This Can Change Unexpectedly"**
**The Analogy**: Like a sign that says "This door might open at any time."

**Why we need it**: Tells the compiler "don't optimize this variable - it can change from outside the program."

#### **`sig_atomic_t` - "Safe for Signal Handlers"**
**The Analogy**: Like using fireproof materials in a fire alarm system.

**Why we need it**: Ensures the variable can be safely read/written in signal handlers.

## **The Shell Loop Implementation**

### **The Analogy: A Restaurant Service Loop**

Think of the shell loop like a **restaurant service loop**:

```c
int shell_loop(t_shell *shell)
{
    char *line;
    int signal_result;

    while (1)  // Keep serving customers
    {
        g_signal = 0;  // Reset emergency status
        line = readline(shell->prompt);  // Take customer order
        
        signal_result = handle_signal_interrupt(shell);
        if (signal_result == 1)  // Emergency evacuation
            break;
        if (signal_result == 2)  // False alarm, continue
            continue;
            
        if (handle_eof(shell, line))  // Customer left
            break;
            
        if (process_input_line(shell, line))  // Process order
            break;
    }
    return (shell->last_status);
}
```

### **Step-by-Step Breakdown**

#### **Step 1: Reset Emergency Status**
```c
g_signal = 0;
```
**The Analogy**: Like checking that all emergency systems are ready.

#### **Step 2: Take Customer Order**
```c
line = readline(shell->prompt);
```
**The Analogy**: Like a waiter asking "What would you like to order?"

#### **Step 3: Check for Emergencies**
```c
signal_result = handle_signal_interrupt(shell);
```
**The Analogy**: Like checking if the fire alarm went off.

#### **Step 4: Handle Customer Leaving**
```c
if (handle_eof(shell, line))
    break;
```
**The Analogy**: Like checking if the customer got up and left.

#### **Step 5: Process the Order**
```c
if (process_input_line(shell, line))
    break;
```
**The Analogy**: Like taking the order to the kitchen.

## **Signal Handler Implementation**

### **The Analogy: Emergency Response Team**

Think of signal handlers like an **emergency response team**:

```c
void signal_handler(int sig)
{
    g_signal = sig;  // Set the emergency flag
}
```

#### **Why This Simple Approach?**
**The Analogy**: Like a fire alarm that just rings - it doesn't put out the fire itself.

**Why we keep it simple**:
- ✅ **Safe**: Signal handlers have limited capabilities
- ✅ **Reliable**: Simple code is less likely to fail
- ✅ **Standard**: This is the recommended approach

#### **What Signal Handlers Can't Do**
**The Analogy**: Like a fire alarm that can't cook food or serve customers.

**Limitations**:
- ❌ **Can't call complex functions** (like printf)
- ❌ **Can't access global variables safely** (except our special one)
- ❌ **Can't do heavy processing**

---

## **History Management**

### **The Analogy: A Restaurant's Order History**

Think of command history like a **restaurant's order history**:

#### **Adding to History**
```c
if (ft_strlen(line) > 0) {
    add_history(line);
}
```
**The Analogy**: Like writing down what the customer ordered.

**What it does**: Remembers the command so you can use it again.

#### **Using History**
**The Analogy**: Like a customer saying "I'll have the same thing as last time."

**How to use**:
- **Up arrow**: Go to previous command
- **Down arrow**: Go to next command
- **Ctrl+R**: Search through history

#### **Clearing History**
```c
rl_clear_history();
```
**The Analogy**: Like clearing the order book at the end of the day.

**When to use**: When you want to start fresh.

## **Why This Design? (Trade-offs and Alternatives)**

### **Why We Chose This Approach**

#### **1. Simple Signal Handling**
**What we did**: Use a global variable to communicate between signal handler and main loop.

**Why this approach**:
- ✅ **Safe**: Follows signal handling best practices
- ✅ **Simple**: Easy to understand and debug
- ✅ **Reliable**: Less likely to have race conditions

**Alternative approaches we rejected**:
- ❌ **Complex signal handling**: Too risky and error-prone
- ❌ **No signal handling**: Would make the shell unresponsive

#### **2. Global Signal Variable**
**What we did**: Use one global variable for all signal communication.

**Why this approach**:
- ✅ **Simple**: Only one variable to track
- ✅ **Efficient**: Minimal overhead
- ✅ **Standard**: Common pattern in system programming

**Alternative approaches we rejected**:
- ❌ **Multiple signal variables**: Unnecessary complexity
- ❌ **No global variables**: Would violate the subject requirements

#### **3. Readline Library**
**What we did**: Use the readline library for input handling.

**Why this approach**:
- ✅ **Professional**: Industry-standard input handling
- ✅ **Feature-rich**: History, editing, completion
- ✅ **Required**: Subject specifically requires it

**Alternative approaches we rejected**:
- ❌ **Manual input handling**: Too much work and less features
- ❌ **Other libraries**: Not required by the subject

## **Common Pitfalls and How We Avoid Them**

### **1. Signal Handler Complexity**
**The Problem**: Trying to do too much in signal handlers.

**The Analogy**: Like a fire alarm trying to cook food.

**How we avoid it**:
```c
// Keep signal handlers simple
void signal_handler(int sig) {
    g_signal = sig;  // Just set the flag
}
```

### **2. Race Conditions**
**The Problem**: Signal handler and main loop accessing variables at the same time.

**The Analogy**: Like two people trying to write in the same notebook.

**How we avoid it**:
- **Use `sig_atomic_t`**: Ensures atomic operations
- **Keep handlers simple**: Minimize shared state
- **Check signals at safe points**: In the main loop, not in handlers

### **3. Memory Leaks in Readline**
**The Problem**: Readline library may have internal memory leaks.

**The Analogy**: Like a restaurant that doesn't clean its own kitchen.

**How we avoid it**:
- **Accept it**: Subject says readline leaks are allowed
- **Focus on our code**: Make sure our code doesn't leak
- **Test with valgrind**: Verify our code is clean

## **Testing Our REPL**

### **The Analogy: Testing a New Restaurant**

Just like you test a new restaurant, we test our REPL.

### **Test Categories**

#### **1. Basic Functionality**
```bash
./minishell
minishell$ echo hello
hello
minishell$ exit
```
**What it tests**: Does the basic REPL work?
**Expected result**: Shows prompt, processes command, exits cleanly

#### **2. Signal Handling**
```bash
./minishell
minishell$ # Press Ctrl+C
minishell$ # Should show new prompt
```
**What it tests**: Does Ctrl+C work correctly?
**Expected result**: Shows new prompt, doesn't exit

#### **3. EOF Handling**
```bash
./minishell
minishell$ # Press Ctrl+D
exit
```
**What it tests**: Does Ctrl+D exit correctly?
**Expected result**: Shows "exit" and exits

#### **4. History**
```bash
./minishell
minishell$ echo first
first
minishell$ echo second
second
minishell$ # Press up arrow
minishell$ echo second  # Should show previous command
```
**What it tests**: Does command history work?
**Expected result**: Up arrow shows previous commands

## **Key Learning Points**

### **1. REPL is the Heart of a Shell**
**What it is**: The main loop that keeps the shell running.

**The Analogy**: Like the main service loop in a restaurant.

**Why it matters**: Without a REPL, you don't have an interactive shell.

### **2. Signal Handling is Critical**
**What it is**: Responding to system interrupts.

**The Analogy**: Like having emergency procedures in a building.

**Why it matters**: Makes the shell responsive and user-friendly.

### **3. Global Variables Have a Purpose**
**What it is**: Using global state for system communication.

**The Analogy**: Like having a status board that everyone can see.

**Why it matters**: Sometimes global state is the right solution for system programming.

### **4. Libraries Save Time**
**What it is**: Using readline for professional input handling.

**The Analogy**: Like using professional kitchen equipment.

**Why it matters**: Don't reinvent the wheel - use proven solutions.
